This project presents a novel **time-domain complex-valued wave equation** for modelling viscoelastic wave propagation in isotropic, homogeneous media with frequency-independent $Q$ attenuation. Building upon the methodology of [Yang & Zhu (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggy323) for visco-acoustic media, we try to extend their approach to the full elastic case by deriving coupled equations for all three displacement components ($u_x$, $u_y$, $u_z$) that account for both P-wave and S-wave attenuation effects. 

Starting from the 3D equations of motion for an isotropic linear-elastic (Cauchy) medium (assuming a Poisson solid, where $\lambda=\mu$), we can introduce the Kolsky-Futterman [Futterman(1962)](https://doi.org/10.1029/JZ067i013p05279) dispersion relation into the frequency-domain elastic wave equations and employ complex-valued analytical wavefields, $\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{u}+i\mathbf{v}$, to separate attenuation and dispersion effects. The logarithmic dispersion term is approximated using a second-order polynomial (with coefficients $a = 5.7356$, $b = -762.1606$, $d = 4.6054 \times 10^4$) [Yang & Zhu (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggy323), which enables easy transformation back to the time domain. The resulting formulation yields a time-domain, second-order, complex-valued partial differential equation (PDE) where dispersion and dissipation are naturally decoupled. I implement the equations using  complex-valued finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) schemes with staggered-grid discretisation for spatial derivatives and second-order accuracy in time. Numerical validation against homogeneous and layered homogeneous models demonstrates the method's capability to accurately simulate viscoelastic wave propagation with realistic $Q$ values.
