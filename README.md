This study presents a novel **time-domain complex-valued wave equation** for modelling viscoelastic wave propagation in isotropic, homogeneous media with frequency-independent $Q$ attenuation. Building upon the methodology of [yang2018time]{goal.com} for visco-acoustic media, we try to extend their approach to the full elastic case by deriving coupled equations for all three displacement components ($u_x$, $u_y$, $u_z$) that account for both P-wave and S-wave attenuation effects.
